            Darrel R. Gibson grew up immersed in aviation, working at his father's Fixed Base Operation, Gibson Aviation Services Inc., in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, from 1961 until 1989. After graduating from high school in 1982, Darrel attended Helena Vocational Technical School, where he earned his Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) license. In 1985, he married his high school sweetheart, Jennifer Leipnitz. Together, they raised three children: Ted, Maddie, and Corbin. By 1987, Darrel had also earned his Inspection Authorization (IA), further solidifying his expertise in aviation maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1989, Darrel’s father, Darrel W. Gibson, retired and sold the family business. Darrel R. remained with the new ownership until 1990, when he accepted a position as an Aircraft Technician with Northwest Airlines. Over the next 15 years, he built a solid career with the airline until the industry was reshaped in the wake of September 11, 2001. As part of a major restructuring, Darrel was laid off.

            Unsure of what to do next, he turned to his father for advice. His father simply said, "Do what you know." Taking those words to heart, Darrel returned to his aviation roots. He opened maintenance shops in Amery and Osceola, Wisconsin, eventually establishing his current operation in Menomonie, Wisconsin, where he also took on the role of Menomonie Municipal Airport Manager in 2012.

            With a career spanning decades and experience working on aircraft ranging from Piper J-3 Cubs to Boeing 747s, Darrel R. Gibson has built a reputation for excellence in aircraft maintenance and flight training across the region.

            <em>"I appreciate the work ethic and knowledge my father passed on to me," says Darrel. "In our shop, we treat every aircraft as if it were our own—never compromising on safety or reliability. Our motto is: ‘Never say can't—and make sure it's better than when you started."</em>
